# fsnvim

## Introduction

> A Vim starting point for writers and other non-developer tech enthusiasts.

WORK IN PROGRESS! *unfinished and subject to change*

Another neovim starting point. IÂ want smooth navigation and a focus on writing, not only coding. The cokeline has both tabs and buffers, and buffers have an association with a tab for ease or organization, toggle with `<Leader>bt`. 
Focus on LateX: visual lines depending on doc type.
Clio idea palace to be implemented.

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.
